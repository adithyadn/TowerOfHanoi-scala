# TowerOfHanoi-scala

Given a number n (n > 0), print out the sequence of steps you would take
to solve the Tower of Hanoi problemâ€”3 rods with n number of disks. 

1. Use purely iterative approach.

2. Use purely a recursive approach.

3. Use a tail recursion instead of regular recursion.

Assume disks are numbered 1, 2, 3,...  Higher the number, larger the disk. 
Also assume the rods are named A, B, and C. The goal is to move all disks from 
A to C, following the rules of the game - you can only move one disk at a time 
and you never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk. 
The object is to move all disks from A to C using fewest moves.
